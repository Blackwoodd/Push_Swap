# Push_Swap

Desciption :
This project solidifies your foundation. The goal is to sort numbers using specific movements.

Rules :
We put numbers in the arguments and the program must sort them in ascending order. 
The numbers are in the A-pillar and we must use the B-pillar to sort them in order.
The movements prevent us from moving the numbers in any way, we can touch the numbers at the ends of the pillars
